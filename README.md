# Flight_Delay_Prediction
A two stage predictive machine learning engine that forecasts the on-time performance of flights for 15 different airports in the USA based on data collected between 2016 and 2017.

# Installation Requirements
## Environment
I recommend having a Linux or macOS development environment for convenience, although the code runs on Windows 10. <br>
Use Anaconda to manage your packages and Python 3 (version >= 3.8.0 recommended). <br>
I also recommend running the code on <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>.

## Dependencies
### With Anaconda, no need to install
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
### Others
Remember to use conda, not pip for installing these
- missingno
